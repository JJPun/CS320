# CS320
I ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure by running certain tests on the entire program to ensure that there are do vulnerabilities or errors in the code. 
I interpret user needs by conversing with the user and noting all of their needs. 
This is then organized and looked over to make a checklist of every need to ensure that it is all met.
I approach designing software in small steps organized to create that bigger picture. 
I spend a lot of time planning and organizing before diving into the actual coding.
Even with the planning, I am still new and find that I forget to include important things in my planning phase.
After planning out the program, I will begin to code. I still have trouble figuring out exactly where to start so I take a long time and still need to look back on the lesson and previous lessons to get through the coding. 
I think with more practice, I will be more efficient and understand all the concepts better as I am more of a hands on learner versus just understanding things from reading it once.
